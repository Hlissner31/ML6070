# CA - 04 Ensemble Models

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook explores ensemble learning techniques, specifically focusing on random forest, AdaBoost, Graident Boost, and XGBoost. The notebook is structured to guide users through data understanding, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation using ensemble methods. The primary objective is to build predictive models and assess their performance using various metrics against how many N_esitmators are used.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the notebook:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is loaded from an external URL:

```
https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-03-Decision-Trees/blob/master/census_data.csv?raw=true
```

The dataset contains various demographic features used to predict outcomes based on ensemble models.

## Contents

1. **Data Understanding and Exploration:**

   - Displaying descriptive statistics
   - Data visualization for initial insights

2. **Model Development:**

   - Random Forest Classifier
   - AdaBoost
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost


3. **Model Evaluation:**

   - Accuracy and AUC
   - Both Graphed against N_estimators

## Usage

To run the notebook, open the file and follow the cells step by step to replicate the analysis and model building process.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed analysis of model performance, including visualization of various ensemble models with the AUC curve and Accuracy score for each.
