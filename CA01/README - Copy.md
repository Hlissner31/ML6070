## CA01

#Install Requirements
Imports of Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and plt of Matplotlib.pyplot

Also from autoviz import AutoViz_Class
if not already installed, use pip install autoviz



#Steps to run code
Need to download "house-price-train.csv" from Dr.Brahma's github

csv file needs to have same file location as the python file running the code

After those steps are completed, the code will run from top to bottom

#What is the code doing?
This code runs through a series of EDA tasks using the house-price-train.csv dataset
Beginning with exploration using a mix of understanding the data shape and graphical representations
afterward autoviz is used to generate a data quality report and cleaning of the data set begins
this file ends with cleaning the dataset of duplicates, outliers, and columns that will likely be
unneeded for analysis.

The document stops after basic cleaning as no machine learning tasks are presented for this assignment.
